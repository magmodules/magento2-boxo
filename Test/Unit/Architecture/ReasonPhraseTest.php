/**
 * A PSR-7 reason phrase may not contain CR or LF, and `Response::__construct` throws
 * `InvalidArgumentException` when it does.
 *
 * Four Magmodules review modules shipped the same line for years:
 *
 *     } catch (GuzzleException $exception) {
 *         $response = $this->responseFactory->create([
 *             'status' => $exception->getCode(),
 *             'reason' => $exception->getMessage()
 *         ]);
 *     }
 *
 * A Guzzle client exception message is multi-line — it appends an excerpt of the response body —
 * so every 4xx and 5xx from the platform turned into a fatal thrown *out of the catch block that
 * was supposed to handle it*. The merchant saw a white screen or a critical log entry instead of
 * "the API rejected this", and the module looked broken rather than the request.
 *
 * The fix is a sanitiser. This test is the net that keeps it: a raw exception message may never
 * be handed to the response factory again, in this module or a module scaffolded from it.
 *
 * BOXO does not build PSR-7 responses today — its cURL client returns arrays — so this passes
 * vacuously. It is here as a net, not as a regression: the day someone adds a response factory to
 * the API client, the defect is caught in the same commit that introduces it.
